- Removed most economic categories to avoid overwriting the entire file
- Removed all clerk modifiers except for produces_add to avoid overwrites.
- Changed all instances of planet_jobs_organic_produces_mult to planet_jobs_organics_produces_mult
- removed all instances of agenda resource mults as only finding the voice provides a resource
- Removed all instances of modifiers from overwrites now that they're removed. I just forgot to keep track of which I removed. This is the same thing as the ones above.

This means there should be no more overwrites, or very few if there is some I missed.
